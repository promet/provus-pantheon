Layout Builder can be implemented as a no-code, site-building tool that retains the features of Drupal, such as flexible content model, revisioning, and custom user permissions and workflows.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by Promet, Provus provides a kickstart to Drupal site building, packaging commonly used features such as calendaring, FAQs, people, news, and blogs with a drag-and-drop content editing experience. Provus also offers a large array of site-building components like galleries, maps, content lists that can be added and arranged by non-technical users, enabling non-technical users to build and edit a site within an inherently flexible content model. Provus is open source and we welcome the Drupal community\u2019s contributions to the project.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Beyond Traditional Drupal Theming<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having identified that component-based theming tools are key to next-level efficiencies in website building, our next step was to single out an optimal approach for delivering reusable components.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional Drupal theming includes css and javascript selectors that are intertwined with their context, connecting them to the backend implementation. The result of this \u201ctheme for the page,\u201d approach is assets that can\u2019t be reused across projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a component-based approach, however, selectors are isolated and can be reused.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s take an example of creating front-end assets for a typical carousel component. In the example below, the assets are tied to the Drupal implementation and combined with other elements. They are not only tied to a paragraph, but the specific name of that paragraph. Reusing this is difficult if there are any changes to the data model.

In the example below, the assets are tied to the Drupal implementation and combined with other elements. They are not only tied to a paragraph, but the specific name of that paragraph. Reusing this is difficult if there are any changes to the data model. We've identified that a flexible data model is what we want to build.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Traditional Drupal Theming<\/h4>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Image removed.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"3fcf7792-8a9f-4f4b-8282-ab37c233c79d\" height=\"16\" src=\"\/core\/misc\/icons\/e32700\/error.svg\" width=\"16\" title=\"This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.\" class=\"filter-image-invalid\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Image removed.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"aaf298dc-1f89-43b0-9eaa-0ffb9069856e\" src=\"\/core\/misc\/icons\/e32700\/error.svg\" title=\"This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" class=\"filter-image-invalid\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h3>\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n<h3>Component-Based Solution<\/h3>\n\n<p>With a component-based approach, on the other hand, all of the assets including the js, css, and template are grouped together. As indicated below, the selectors only reference the elements in the template, so they are isolated within a coherent whole.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Image removed.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"8d59a79e-1763-4d03-9799-9d4be576dcf4\" src=\"\/core\/misc\/icons\/e32700\/error.svg\" title=\"This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" class=\"filter-image-invalid\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Making component-based theming work in Drupal, can simply be a matter of embedding. We are able to leverage Twig\u2019s ability to embed or include templates to render the component. If the backend implementation changes or we want to move it to another project the component itself is not changed.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Below is an example of embedding the previous component. In this case, changing the block type or backend implementation simply requires embedding the same component.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Image removed.\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"dcfadb1d-5ed5-4f0e-add6-78ea61737554\" src=\"\/core\/misc\/icons\/e32700\/error.svg\" title=\"This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed.\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\" class=\"filter-image-invalid\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Drag-and-Drop Content Management Systems represent a new level of advantages and possibilities for development teams, and even more so for clients. At Promet Source, we\u2019re excited about the approach to component-based theming that we\u2019ve developed, and looking forward to the conversations and amazing new solutions that lie ahead for clients.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n<p>Interested in learning more about the potential for drag-and-drop content management systems and what this can mean for you?\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.prometsource.com\/contact\">Contact us<\/a>\u00a0today.<\/p>",
